# HFAndroidDevelopment

The files are divided by chapters following the book ones. 
So folder "hfad3" = files about the chapter 3.

Folder 4.1 is the first part of chapter 4.
I learned about how to work with the constraint layout and how to use guidelines and barriers. 

Folder 4.2 is the second part of the chapter 4.
I build a constraint Layout and used chains.

VOE ALTO DE FORMA LEVE!!
LIKE A RD.
